Kishan and Hardik steadied the innings after the top-order failed in the Pakistan clash.\r\nKishan was dismissed while trying to play a rash shot but Gavaskar said he wouldn&#039;t be harsh on the Indian batter and would rather pat him on the back.\r\n\r\n&quot;Yes. I mean, you can you can, you know, if you want to nitpick, you can do that. But, you know, you&#039;ve got to give credit to the young man for coming in a crisis situation and scoring 82 runs and having that partnership. I think if he was discomforted by some injury, it is only natural for him to know to think that because he cannot run fast between the wickets, he should be looking for the boundary. So that&#039;s totally understandable at all. So I wouldn&#039;t point a finger at him at all. I would just pat him on the back and say, Well done to the young man,&quot; said Gavaskar.\r\n\r\nGavaskar also had praise reserved for Hardik and the way he guided Kishan through the partnership.\r\n\r\n&quot;Absolutely incredible. Yes, I think again no praise can be too high for the way he shepherded Ishan Kishan through that partnership. And of course, scoring runs himself hitting the boundaries, picking the ones and twos. And he showed that, you know, in a crisis situation to rise to the occasion, that was terrific innings,&quot; said Gavaskar.\r\nKishan was dismissed while trying to play a rash shot but Gavaskar said he wouldn&#039;t be harsh on the Indian batter and would rather pat him on the back.\r\n\r\n&quot;Yes.

And he showed that, you know, in a crisis situation to rise to the occasion, that was terrific innings,&quot; said Gavaskar.\r\nSunil Gavaskar praised the partnership between Ishan Kishan and Hardik Pandya during India&#039;s clash against Pakistan on Saturday, September 2.\r\n\r\nThe duo managed to create a record-breaking partnership of 138 runs for India against Pakistan at Pallekele International Cricket Stadium, Pallekele. This partnership is considered the highest for the fifth-wicket or lower order for India.\r\n\r\nThe match started off on a rocky note for India, with key players like Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, and Shubman Gill losing their wickets early in the game. However, Kishan and Pandya displayed remarkable composure and resilience, guiding India back to stability. Their partnership lasted for 141 balls, combining controlled aggression with calculated risks, which kept the scoreboard ticking while capitalizing on loose deliveries.\r\nKishan, known for his aggressive strokeplay, scored 82 off 81 balls, featuring nine fours and two sixes, displaying an impressive strike rate of 101.23.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Hardik Pandya, achieved a total of 87 runs from 90 balls at the strike rate of 96.67, hitting seven boundaries and one six. This partnership surpassed the previous record set by Rahul Dravid and Mohammed Kaif back in 2005 at Nagpur, where they forged a 135-run partnership.\r\n\r\nAsia Cup 2023, IND vs PAK: Report\r\n\r\nGavaskar, while talking to India Today, first praised Kishan for his knock and said that the wicketkeeper showed that openers can bat in the middle-order. The Indian legend said that without the partnership, India would have been well short of the 266 they put on the board in the end.\r\n\r\n\r\n&quot;Yes, I think what he showed was that an opening batter can bat anywhere down the order. It&#039;s not easy the other way around, where a middle order batter can come in and open the batting. It&#039;s not easy, but an opening batter can be accommodated anywhere down the order, and he brings a left-handed dimension to the Indian batting line. If you could look at the top four, they&#039;re all right and then the left hander comes in, so it makes it a little bit difficult for the bowlers. &quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;Plus, he&#039;s got this great ability to accelerate. He looks very, very small, but he packs a punch. He hit a couple of big sixes and the way he batted really was impressive because generally he likes to get after the bowling. But he was watchful when it was needed, recognized, realised what the situation was.&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;There was, of course, Hardik Pandya at the other end who captained the Gujarat Titans. So he knows exactly you know what situation, how to adjust his game and he was guiding him. So that was a very, very good partnership. Without that partnership, India would have 175 or 200,&quot; said Gavaskar.', 'ind-vs-pak-021523-16x9.avif', 8, 6, '2023-09-03 00:00:00', 1, 1),

As the news director for CHCO-TV—an independent, nonprofit television station in rural New Brunswick, Canada—she livestreamed town council meetings, posted monthly video interviews with local mayors, and shared at least a dozen posts daily. For many in the community of St. Andrews and the larger Charlotte County, it was the way to stay on top of local news.\r\n\r\nOne day in early August, that all ground to a halt. Meta had finally made good on a promise to block news content in Canada, in response to a new law that requires the company to pay news businesses for content that ends up on Facebook or Instagram. The CHCO-TV Facebook page, followed by 28,000 people—nearly 2,000 more than the entire county—has been wiped clean. “No posts available,” the newsfeed reads.\r\nSince 2008—the year after Facebook recentered its design around the newsfeed—Canada has lost 474 local news outlets, according to the latest report from the crowd-sourced Local News Research Project. Meanwhile, Facebook and Google together gobble up 80 percent of digital advertising dollars in Canada, leaving the country’s ever-dwindling news business to fight over the scraps. In 2021–2022, the government of Canada itself spent $11.4 million on Facebook and Instagram ads alone, and $64 million total on digital ads—more than half of its annual ad budget.\r\n\r\nThe issue of Meta and Google’s dominance over ad revenue has been the underlying catalyst of new legislation known as the Online News Act, or Bill C-18. Passed in June, C-18 requires companies like Meta and Alphabet to pay Canadian news businesses when their content ends up on “digital news intermediary” platforms.\r\nLong before the bill was passed, Meta warned the government that the only way it could comply with the law was to “end news availability” in Canada, effectively blocking Canadians’ ability to post and view links to news sites, including non-Canadian outlets. Many news companies warned the government that C-18 would devastate an already struggling industry. The Canadian government doubled down, saying that Meta should support the news industry it helped decimate.\r\n\r\nCanada believed it could play hardball and win, as Australia had done the year prior with its news media bargaining code. With the world watching, Canada rushed C-18 through before breaking for summer vacation. It hoped the legislation would set a precedent others could emulate. And then the wildfires struck.\r\n\r\nNow, government officials and news outlets caught in the crossfire are now learning a lesson in the hardest way possible: Meta does not bend to governments, even when lives are at stake.\r\nSitting three miles from the US state of Maine, on the edge of the Bay of Fundy, St. Andrews is the kind of place where everybody knows each other.

Some of our feathered friends are capable of complex cognitive tasks, including tool use (SN: 2/10/23). Among the brainiest feats that birds are capable of is vocal learning, or the ability to learn to mimic sounds and use them to communicate. In birds, this leads to beautiful calls and songs; in humans, it leads to language.\r\n\r\nThe best avian vocal learners, such as crows and parrots, also tend to be considered the most intelligent birds. So it’s natural to think that the two traits could be linked. But studies with smart birds have found conflicting evidence. Although vocal learning may be linked with greater cognitive capacity in some species, the opposite relationship seems to hold true in others.\r\nNow, a massive analysis of 214 birds from 23 species shows that there is indeed a link between vocal learning and at least one advanced cognitive ability — problem-solving. The study, described in the Sept. 15 Science, is the first to analyze multiple bird species instead of just one.', '091323_DI_birdsong-smarts_bird_feature-1030x580.jpg', 8, 5, '2023-09-17 07:30:55', 1, 1),

Before they were detected, these ripples in spacetime existed only in the physicist’s general theory of relativity, as far as scientists knew.\r\n\r\nNow, researchers have not one but two ways to detect the waves. And they’re on the hunt for more. The study of gravitational waves is booming, says astrophysicist Karan Jani of Vanderbilt University in Nashville. “This is just remarkable. No field I can think of in fundamental physics has seen progress this fast.”\r\nJust as light comes in a spectrum, or a variety of wavelengths, so do gravitational waves. Different wavelengths point to different types of cosmic origins and require different flavors of detectors.\r\n\r\nGravitational waves with wavelengths of a few thousand kilometers — like those detected by LIGO in the United States and its partners Virgo in Italy and KAGRA in Japan — come mostly from merging pairs of black holes 10 or so times the mass of the sun, or from collisions of dense cosmic nuggets called neutron stars (SN: 2/11/16). These detectors could also spot waves from certain types of supernovas — exploding stars — and from rapidly rotating neutron stars called pulsars (SN: 5/6/19).\r\nIn contrast, immense ripples that span light-years are thought to be created by orbiting pairs of whopper black holes with masses billions of times that of the sun. In June, scientists reported the first strong evidence for these types of waves by turning the entire galaxy into a detector, watching how the waves tweaked the timing of regular blinks from pulsars scattered throughout the Milky Way (SN: 6/28/23).  \r\n\r\nWith the equivalent of both small ripples and major tsunamis in hand, physicists now hope to plunge into a vast, cosmic ocean of gravitational waves of all sorts of sizes. These ripples could reveal new details about the secret lives of exotic objects such as black holes and unknown facets of the cosmos.\r\n“There’s still a lot of gaps in our coverage of the gravitational wave spectrum,” says physicist Jason Hogan of Stanford University. But it makes sense to cover all the bases, he says. “Who knows what else we might find?”\r\n\r\nThis quest to capture the full complement of the universe’s gravitational waves could take observatories out into deep space or the moon, to the atomic realm and elsewhere.', '090523_ec_gravitational-waves_feat-1030x580.jpg', 8, 5, '2023-09-17 07:33:06', 1, 1),

Crackdowns on these illegal activities have helped reduce sugar prices.\r\n\r\nAccording to the PBS, the average price of sugar dropped to Rs165.40/kg in the week under review, compared to Rs181.98 in the previous week. About a year ago, sugar was available at an average price of Rs86.93/kg nationwide.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the average chicken price decreased to Rs358.14/kg in the week, compared to Rs389.46/kg in the previous week. A year ago, it was available at Rs282.13/kg.\r\n\r\nIn general, however, food prices remained near their recent highs, squeezing the households’ purchasing power and disposable income over the past year and a half.\r\n\r\nThese price increases were partly due to rising global food and energy prices and partly due to the significant depreciation of the rupee, which made imports more expensive.\r\n\r\nThe central bank anticipated that the monthly inflation reading, measured through the Consumer Price Index (CPI), would remain high in September and start decreasing from October onwards. Prices are expected to sharply decline in the second half of the current fiscal year 2023-24.\r\n\r\nIn its monetary policy statement on Thursday, the central bank said that though inflation came down in July-August FY24 compared to May, “the decline was lower than anticipated largely due to the surge in global oil prices and their pass-through to administered energy prices.”\r\n\r\nEven though global oil prices have risen recently and are being passed on to consumers through adjustment in energy prices, “inflation is projected to remain on the downward trajectory, especially from the second half of this year,” the bank said.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, according to the PBS, major price increases were observed in tomatoes, which increased by 4.29% compared to the previous week, garlic rose by 4.21%, bread by 3.92%, onions by 3.60%, masoor pulse by 3.19%, powdered salt by 2.77%, shirting fabric by 1.68%, moong pulse by 1.66%, printed lawn by 1.32%, mash pulse by 1.25%, and long cloth by 1.18% during the week ending September 14, 2023.', 'inflation1678509363-0.jpg', 8, 1, '2023-09-17 08:38:21', 1, 1),

Her goal is to set up a $20 million fund for this purpose. photo: file\r\nGENEVA:\r\nThe Chief of the World Trade Organisation, Ngozi Okonjo, has called upon member states to ratify the fisheries subsidies agreement. However, Pakistan may not be on the list of ratifying nations due to a constitutional limit that bars the interim government from entering into a long-term treaty.\r\n\r\nNgozi has termed the ratification of the agreement as her topmost priority for the upcoming Ministerial Conference aimed at ending overfishing and the depletion of oceans.\r\n\r\nIn an interaction with a group of journalists from developing countries, the Director-General of the WTO urged member states, including Pakistan, to ratify the fisheries subsidies agreement so that it can enter into force next year. The 13th Ministerial Conference is taking place in the United Arab Emirates in February next year.\r\n\r\nThe first deliverable for the 13th Ministerial Conference is entering into force the fisheries subsidies agreement, said Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala. “Our oceans are 50% overfished. There is an urgency as we cannot waste too much time in ratifying this agreement.”\r\n\r\nSo far, 43 members have ratified the agreement, but we need 110 states to ratify it before making it effective, she added. She said that the process of ratification was gaining pace.\r\n\r\nGovernments around the world are providing over $22 billion in subsidies that increase the capacity to overfish in seas. The consensus agreement prohibits subsidies for illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing, for overfishing, and fishing of unmanaged stocks in the high seas.\r\n\r\nPakistan cannot ratify the agreement at this stage as the interim government does not have a mandate to enter into a long-term treaty, said a Geneva-based Pakistani official. The interim government’s maximum three-month constitutional term ends on November 9, but the elections are unlikely to take place before that due to other considerations.\r\n\r\nPakistan emphasises the need for responsible subsidies that do not contribute to overfishing while considering the “polluter pays” concept for nations providing excessive subsidies. It also advocates for special and differential treatment, excluding large-scale industrial distant water fishing nations and allowing subsidies for low-income fishing activities.\r\n\r\nPakistan also wants prioritisation of capacity building, sustainable practices, and tailored support for developing countries.\r\n\r\nHowever, the DG said that the facility for capacity building can only be offered to states ratifying the agreement. Her goal is to set up a $20 million fund for this purpose.\r\n\r\nShe said that the WTO also wants to begin negotiations for the second phase of the fisheries subsidies agreement to improve the June 2022 version.\r\n\r\nShe also spoke about challenges being faced by the multilateral trading system.\r\n\r\n“People tend to take trade for granted. Seventy-five percent of the global trade of today takes place on WTO’s Most Favoured Nations terms, meaning it is taking place under all the rules agreed with the WTO,” said Ngozi. “We are not so concerned about the bilateral and regional trade agreements because three-quarters of the World Trade is still taking place under WTO terms,” she added.\r\n\r\nThe geopolitical tensions have overshadowed global trade initiatives, prompting many to question the relevance of the multilateral trading system.\r\n\r\n“If we remove WTO rules today, then what would you have? There would be no agreements underpinning world trade, which will result in an anarchic situation,” said the DG. “Some of the other standards on which trade is done, such as technical standards and food standards, all come from WTO. The bilateral and regional agreements are patterned on WTO rules, and some of them are quite innovative that are built on WTO rules but have other chapters added.”\r\n\r\nShe said that despite supply chain challenges during Covid-19 and the Ukraine War, trade proved to be really resilient. The multilateral system delivered vaccines after the initial hiccups. “Without the trading system, we could never have this exchange of vaccines between producers and end-users. At a time when food inflation is high and people have not been able to import from the Black Sea region due to the Ukraine war, supplies are ensured from other regions,” she added. Europe has found energy supplies from other parts when they could not get them from Russia.\r\n\r\nShe said that there is an atmosphere of pessimism, the world is fragmented, but we are not at the point where the trading system is falling apart. “We will focus on issues during the 13th MC that the WTO can deliver.”\r\n\r\nWTO reforms are needed to make the dispute settlement mechanism operational, which is a big deliverable for the next meeting, but it’s not easy, said the DG. She listed agriculture as another deliverable and hoped that some breakthrough can be made despite “very tough” issues. Some members want to work on distortive subsidies, and others want to discuss the issue of stockpiles. Some countries only want market access, she added.\r\n\r\nIt has been 22 years of negotiations on agriculture, and we have to ask ourselves how do we break the back of it and try to deliver something that is acceptable to the developing world. She said that developing countries are expecting to get benefits from the WTO, and we have to deliver on it. She said that Bangladesh will be upgraded from the least developed country status to a developing country by 2026.\r\n\r\nThe issue of further extension in e-commerce moratorium for not charging custom duties on electronic transactions will be on the next meeting&#039;s agenda. She said that trade is going digital, and developing countries are keen to earn additional revenues.\r\n\r\nThe Director-General is going to introduce deliberative sessions to provide a platform for member countries to discuss different issues.', '11694721009-0.jpg', 8, 1, '2023-09-17 08:41:04', 1, 1),

(44, 'Food, water, taxes, now electricity – no relief for the common man', 'Present-day Pakistan stands at a crossroads, grappling with a number of issues of grave concern, which are reminiscent of the prelude to the French Revolution. Energy crises, economic downturns, political instability, and religious intolerance cast an intricate web which is severely affecting the lower strata of the society.\r\n\r\nThe recent incident of the horrifyingly high electricity bills appears to be breaking the backs of the downtrodden in the country. Much like the Third Estate of pre-revolutionary France, the common people of Pakistan find themselves under the burden of the financial crises, which lie largely beyond their control. People took to the streets to protest against the unjustifiable hike in energy prices, and some even resorted to burning their bills.\r\n\r\nAmidst the backdrop of soaring bills and the resultant eruption of protests, the caretaker government with the federal cabinet decided to provide “relief” to the people. For this purpose, an emergency meeting was called where the Ministry of Energy presented different proposals before the federal cabinet. The considerations included the option to pay bills in more than two instalments, reducing the tax on the bills, and potentially removing free-electricity privileges for the members of the power sector and government officers.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the meeting did not yield the desired results, and the government averred that it could not actualise these proposals before seeking the approval of the International Monetary Fund. It is noteworthy to mention that one of the primary reasons for high electricity bills is the government’s high taxation policy. This fact highlights that the lower and middle socio-economic classes bear the brunt of these poor policies more than any other segment of society, a point that cannot be underemphasised.\r\n\r\nIn a nation where economic disparities are glaring, with the privileged maintaining their status and the marginalised struggling to put food on the table and survive, such disproportionate taxation strikes a dissonant chord. The erstwhile federal government allocated a hefty budget for the parliament members, while basic needs like affordable electricity elude the masses. This is just one of the instances of how the men in power further their nests at the expense of common people in this country. This aggravates socio-economic inequalities, and the lower segments of society are further driven into the corner to atone for the events leading to the deficit.\r\n\r\nOver and above, Pakistan satisfies over a third of its annual electricity requirements by using imported natural gas. Global crisis, for instance, the Russia-Ukraine war, led to a hike in the prices. It became really challenging for Pakistan because of the country’s already staggering economy. At the beginning of 2023, the government implemented different measures to conserve energy, resulting in long bouts of power cuts. Despite these nuisances, the governments in Pakistan seem unable to fix the priorities of the nation.\r\n\r\nTo extenuate the scourge of economic crisis, Pakistan will have to take long-term, sagacious policy measures. Regarding the power generation debacle, the World Bank suggests that Pakistan has great potential to generate wind and solar energy. In its report, the World Bank mentioned that the utilisation of merely 0.071% of the country’s land for solar energy generation could meet the electricity demands. Investment in renewable sources of energy can help to make power affordable for the citizens in addition to achieving the goal of energy security. The matter boils down to setting the priorities straight.\r\n\r\nDue to the highly uncertain politico-economic milieu, Pakistan has already witnessed gruesome incidents in the ongoing year. The skyrocketing pace of inflation, along with the increasing rate of unemployment and other maladies, seem to weigh on the collective conscience of the masses. Needless to say, other factors are also important in giving rise to these harrowing incidents, but the economic burdens seem to be taking the lead in generating such a scenario.', '2230829439071693367034-0.jpg', 8, 1, '2023-09-17 08:45:55', 1, 1),

The 36-year-old athlete revealed that despite the challenges, their bond remains strong.\r\n\r\nAppearing on This Morning alongside hosts Alison Hammond and Dermot O&#039;Leary, Khan openly discussed the situation, saying, &#039;I&#039;m not a spring chicken. I&#039;ve not trained for two years...My wife has started having a go at me saying to get in the gym, saying you&#039;ve started to get a dad&#039;s body.&quot; Continuing further, he said, &quot;I used to see a gym and go in, now I see a gym and walk past it.&quot;\r\n\r\nKhan&#039;s admission comes after a tumultuous few weeks that saw his relationship with Makhdoom tested. Last month, former BBC presenter Suzi Mann accused the boxer of making unwelcome sexual advances towards her, alleging that he had sent explicit messages and voicemails after they had met at an event in 2016. Mann explained that she felt uncomfortable with Amir&#039;s messages but chose to maintain her professionalism and not entertain his behaviour.\r\n\r\nThe allegations against Khan followed previous reports of a sexting scandal in which he allegedly solicited revealing pictures from a model, which resulted in a separation from his wife. The couple, who have been married for a decade and have three children together, appear to have resolved their differences and are back together. \r\n\r\nKhan also discussed the significant lifestyle change he experienced after retiring from boxing, noting the shift from a rigorous training regimen to a more relaxed routine. &quot;You&#039;re always in training camp every day or you’re going for a run, you&#039;re always burning calories,&quot; he said on the Chris Moyles Show on Radio X.', '1776_2039380_1_Amir-Khan-Faryal-Khan_updates1694883700-0.jpg', 8, 2, '2023-09-17 09:28:07', 1, 1),
(50, 'An Apple Exclusive Reveals iPhone 14&#039;s Shocking Price', 'According to Apple rumours, iPhone 14 Pro variants would cost more and receive a number of exclusive enhancements. However, a recent source asserts that even though the regular iPhone 14 models are essentially unaltered from their predecessors, they will also see a price increase.\r\n\r\nDan Ives, the leader of well-known analyst firm Wedbush Securities, explained the rise in supply chain prices while speaking to The Sun. We anticipate a $100 price increase for the iPhone 14 in the near future, Ives said. Cupertino must pass on these expenses to the user with this release because prices have been rising throughout the whole supply chain.\r\n\r\nIf accurate, the iPhone 14 lineup would look like this:\r\n\r\niPhone 14 - $899 (iPhone 13 $799)\r\niPhone 14 Max - $999 (iPhone 13 Mini $699)\r\niPhone 14 Pro - $1099 (iPhone 13 Pro $999)\r\niPhone 14 Pro Max - $1199 (iPhone 13 Pro Max $1099)\r\nEven if the standard models, which would have the same design, rear cameras, and chipset as the iPhone 13, will suffer from the $100 price increase, the biggest financial damage comes from the range&#039;s starting point rising from $699 to $899.\r\n\r\nAs a result of Apple cancelling the 5.4-inch iPhone 13 Mini in favour of the 6.7-inch iPhone 14 Max (also rumoured to be dubbed the &quot;iPhone 14 Plus&quot;), which forces iPhone 14 into the base model position, there has been an almost 30% spike in prices.\r\nThe big news is that the schematics confirm numerous rumours that Apple will keep the notch, even if it is anticipated that it will only be used on non-Pro models. However, at this point, the dimensions they provide seem to be more intriguing information:\r\n\r\niPhone 14 Pro Max - 160.71 x 78.78 x 7.85mm\r\niPhone 13 Pro Max - 160.8 x 78.1 x 7.65 mm\r\nEven while the variations are minimal, they disprove a common theory that Apple will employ the same chassis for the iPhone 14 Pro variants as its predecessors. Apple already raised the base price for the iPhone 14 range to $799 from the $699 of the iPhone 13 lineup by dropping the Mini, and the company avoids significant extra expenditures by using many of the same components for the regular iPhone 14 models as the iPhone 13.\r\n\r\nThis makes room for higher iPhone 14 Pro prices, more hardware variety, and better upsell opportunities. If the reports are accurate, this is a marketing tactic that will alienate buyers at a time of increasing worldwide inflation. \r\n\r\nOne common industry counterargument exists. That is, instead of the $200 difference mentioned above, Apple will maintain the iPhone 13 pricing for the iPhone 14 and the lack of an iPhone 14 Mini will only result in a $100 entry-level price rise. This, however, does not take into consideration the increase in supply chain pricing, thus it can turn out to be unduly optimistic.\r\n\r\n', 's3r6G1r2FZoMmDFsp3xTDbIutb6jN4GpHrLBvERJ.jpeg', 8, 7, '2023-09-17 09:30:46', 1, 1),

But something didn’t add up.\r\n\r\nThe Iceman is about 5,300 years old. Other people with steppe ancestry didn’t appear in the genetic record of central Europe until about 4,900 years ago. Ötzi “is too old to have that type of ancestry,” says archaeogeneticist Johannes Krause of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany. The mummy “was always an outlier.”\r\n\r\nBrain implants for depression\r\nFind out about the experimental treatment and the people it’s helping in our six-part newsletter, Electricity Saved My Brain, arriving weekly starting whenever you sign up.\r\n\r\nname@provider.com\r\nSign Up\r\nKrause and colleagues put together a new genetic instruction book for the Iceman. The old genome was heavily contaminated with modern people’s DNA, the researchers report August 16 in Cell Genomics. The new analysis reveals that “the steppe ancestry is completely gone.”\r\n\r\nBut the Iceman still has oddities. About 90 percent of Ötzi’s genetic heritage comes from Neolithic farmers, an unusually high amount compared with other Copper Age remains, Krause says.\r\n\r\nThe Iceman’s new genome also reveals he had male-pattern baldness and much darker skin than artistic representations suggest. Genes conferring light skin tones didn’t become prevalent until 4,000 to 3,000 years ago when early farmers started eating plant-based diets and didn’t get as much vitamin D from fish and meat as hunter-gathers did, Krause says.\r\n\r\nAs Ötzi and other ancient people’s DNA illustrate, the skin color genetic changes took thousands of years to become commonplace in Europe.\r\n\r\n“People that lived in Europe between 40,000 years ago and 8,000 years ago were as dark as people in Africa, which makes a lot of sense because [Africa is] where humans came from,” he says. “We have always imagined that [Europeans] became light-skinned much faster. But now it seems that this happened actually quite late in human history.”', '081523_ts_otzi_feat-1030x580.jpg', 8, 5, '2023-09-17 09:34:13', 0, 1);

(52, 'AI can now turn blurry thermal vision into crisp images', 'Thermal imaging, the basis of many night-vision systems, works by detecting heat. It also tends to provide few details. So imaged objects often appear fuzzy or even ghostly. But such blurry, two-tone imagery may soon become a thing of the past. Researchers have now paired artificial intelligence (AI) with thermal vision. Their new system can deliver crisp, detailed images — even in pitch darkness.\r\n\r\nThe new tech is costly and still a bit clunky. But one day, it just might boost the ability of self-driving vehicles to navigate better.\r\n\r\nThe infrared — heat — images typical of night-vision goggles appear blurry. It’s due to “ghosting,” where an object’s heat overwhelms any details of its texture. (It’s like how turning on a light might make it difficult to decipher any printing on a glass bulb.)\r\n\r\nFanglin Bao is a theoretical physicist at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Ind. He was part of a team that used a type of thermal camera that can tell the difference between various infrared hues, or wavelengths. The researchers paired that camera with a computer program. It uses AI to untangle information from the camera’s data. This reveals the temperature, texture and makeup of imaged objects.\r\n\r\nScientists Say: Artificial intelligence\r\nThe technique can turn dark, nighttime scenes into bright, detailed images. The AI system can even match something it perceives in an image — such as water, sand or a tree — to the color that material would have in daylight. Then it paints those images on the screen in somewhat realistic daytime hues.\r\n\r\nThe team described this system July 26 in Nature.\r\n\r\n“There is no restriction of harsh weather conditions or nighttime scenarios,” says Muhammad Ali Farooq. He’s an electrical engineer at the University of Galway in Ireland, who did not take part in the work. That means “you can get very good and very crisp data — even in low lighting,” he says.\r\n\r\nMany cameras can measure distances to the objects on which they’re focused. The new camera system can, too, although in a different way — but with about the same accuracy. That means it might one day be useful in self-driving vehicles. They have to know how far away something is. That’s what allows a car to automatically brake in time to avoid smashups.\r\n\r\nCurrent self-driving vehicles often gauge distance by bouncing signals off of objects. That’s also how radar and sonar work. But self-driving cars might confuse each other if they were all sending out signals at once. The new technique doesn’t beam out signals. So it might be safer to scale up in a world with roads full of self-driving cars, Bao’s team says.  \r\n\r\nEven so, don’t expect to see cars with this system cruising through busy streets any time soon. Its camera is hefty — and about a half meter (1.6 feet) on each side. The whole system also costs more than $1 million, Bao notes. Finally, producing each image takes about a second. That’s way too slow for a self-driving vehicle that needs to respond to road conditions lickety-split.\r\n\r\nStill, Bao looks forward to seeing what future versions of this tech might do for autonomous vehicles or robots. He suspects they could soon interpret scenes — and navigate at night — far better than people can today.', '082323_lmz_hadar_feat-1030x580.jpg', 8, 7, '2023-09-17 09:35:55', 1, 1),
